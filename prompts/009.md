# can you add a cyclone dx sbom creation into the build?
When a build is performed, a cyclone dx compatible sbom should be created in the distribution or the bin directory of the project, so that we can analyze vulnerabilities.

# chats response
Added CycloneDX SBOM generation to the build, so each npm run build now creates dist/sbom.json.

What changed

Build now runs SBOM generation: package.json scripts build and new sbom.
Added CycloneDX CLI dependency: @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm.
Added an acceptance test to verify the SBOM step is wired.
Test run

npm run test
Note: npm install now triggers prepare which runs build and generates dist/sbom.json. You’ll see SBOM output on install/link.

If you want the SBOM in bin/ instead of dist/, tell me which path you prefer and I’ll switch the script.
