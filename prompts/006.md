# Swap the placeholder chart stub for an embedded Chart.js bundle (still local/inlined)

# chats response
Swapped the placeholder chart stub for an inline Chart.js bundle by loading node_modules/chart.js/dist/chart.umd.js and embedding it directly in the report HTML, and added a DSL assertion to verify the bundle is present.

Changes

Inlined Chart.js bundle in the report HTML and removed the placeholder stub in src/report-generator.ts.
Added thenEmbeddedChartJsPresent to the DSL and refined the external-asset check to only flag actual external src/href/url() references in tests/dsl/ci-report.dsl.ts.
Added Chart.js to dev dependencies in package.json.
Test run

npm run test
Next steps you might want

Wire actual chart initialization in the report (create Chart.js instances from the embedded chart-data-* blocks).
Run npm run is-this-ci -- origin/main to regenerate the report and inspect the inline bundle size.
