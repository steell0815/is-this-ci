# Can you add a sbom specific link to sunshine to give the user to option to observe vulnerabilities of the tool?
- Link to Sunshine: https://cyclonedx.github.io/Sunshine
- Using generated sbom.json from the dist folder

# chats response
Added a Sunshine link action to the report header, tied to the generated SBOM path.

What changed

Added an “Open in Sunshine” button under the header with the SBOM path (dist/sbom.json).
Button opens Sunshine in a new tab and prompts the user to upload the local dist/sbom.json.
Styled the button to match the report.
File updated

src/report-generator.ts
Test run

npm run test
Regenerate the report with:

npm run is-this-ci -- origin/main
If you want a direct deep link once Sunshine supports local file URLs, I can wire it in.

# we were misaligned - the sbom.json must be part of the installed package.
So somehow, the contents of the json should be made available to sunshinedx.
Definitely not the contents from the project/dist/sbom, but rather during the build an sbom is created. This sbom should be made available inside the installable npm package.

# chats response
Aligned SBOM handling with your requirement: the report now embeds the SBOM from the installed package’s dist/sbom.json, so the contents are available to Sunshine. I also added a “Download SBOM” button alongside “Open in Sunshine” and included the embedded SBOM as JSON in the HTML.

What changed

Embed dist/sbom.json as <script id="sbom-json">…</script> from the tool’s install root.
Add “Download SBOM” button that saves the embedded SBOM locally.
Keep the Sunshine link and prompt to upload the SBOM.
Added acceptance checks for SBOM embed + Sunshine link.

Next step

Regenerate the report: npm run is-this-ci -- origin/main
Use “Download SBOM” and upload it into Sunshine.
If you want the Sunshine link to automatically open the SBOM (when Sunshine supports URL ingestion), I can wire it to a data URL.
