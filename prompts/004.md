# please add github actions workflow to establish a continuous integration pipeline on the underlying repository, executing all tests on commit.
1. in case a test is failing inform the author via e-Mail

# chats response
Added a GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs tests on every push and emails on failures.

Changes

Added /.github/workflows/ci.yml with npm ci + npm test, and a failure notification job via dawidd6/action-send-mail.
Test run

npm run test (pass)
You’ll need to set these GitHub Secrets for email delivery:

SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD
CI_FAILURE_TO, CI_FAILURE_FROM
If you want, I can also add a short README section documenting the secrets and workflow behavior.

# remove again the email and corresponding secrets in the pipeline, anyways they are part of githubs functionality.

# chats response
Removed the email notification job from the CI workflow.

Test run

npm run test (pass)
Updated file

.github/workflows/ci.yml
If you want any GitHub-native notification settings documented (e.g., CODEOWNERS, GitHub notifications), tell me where to add it.
