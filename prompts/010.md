# chats response
The CI failure is because bin/is-this-ci.js was gitignored, so it never made it into the repo. I removed /bin from .gitignore and added a test to prevent this regression.

Changes

Removed /bin from .gitignore so the CLI wrapper is tracked.
Added a CLI install assertion that bin/ is not gitignored.
Test run

npm run test
Please commit the bin/is-this-ci.js file and .gitignore change, then re-run CI. The wrapper will now exist in GitHub Actions.

If you want, I can also add a CI check to verify the wrapper is executable.
