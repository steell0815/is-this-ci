# please, whenever you perform a change
perform
```npm run test```
always start with a red test
change production code minimal to achive a green test
refactor (DRY principle, Separation of concern, Readability favored to cleverness)

# chats response
Understood — I’ll follow that Red → Green → Refactor loop and run npm run test on every change from here on.

Right now tests are green after the last fix:

npm run test passes (1 test)
If you want me to proceed with the next change, tell me the next test to add or the next behavior to implement.
